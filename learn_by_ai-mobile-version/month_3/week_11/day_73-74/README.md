# **üîπ Day 73-74: Revision & Debugging**  

In these two days, we will focus on revising the advanced topics covered in Week 11 and debugging techniques to enhance your understanding and skills in JavaScript. 

### **üî∏ Key Topics to Revise:**

1. **Web Workers:**
   - Understand how to create and manage Web Workers.
   - Practice using Web Workers for heavy computations without blocking the main thread.
   - Revisit examples of using `postMessage` and receiving messages.

2. **Service Workers:**
   - Review the concept of Service Workers and their role in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
   - Revisit setting up caching strategies for offline capabilities.
   - Practice intercepting network requests and using the `fetch` event.

3. **CORS:**
   - Understand how CORS works and the importance of CORS headers.
   - Revise examples of handling CORS in server applications.
   - Practice implementing CORS in a sample Express.js application.

4. **Security Best Practices:**
   - Revise the key security practices to protect web applications (input validation, HTTPS, CSP, etc.).
   - Discuss common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection) and how to mitigate them.

5. **WebSockets:**
   - Revisit the chat application project and understand how WebSockets provide real-time communication.
   - Discuss the differences between WebSockets and traditional HTTP requests.

### **üî∏ Debugging Techniques:**

1. **Browser Developer Tools:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the various tabs in browser dev tools (Elements, Console, Network, Sources).
   - Learn how to inspect elements, view console logs, and debug JavaScript code step-by-step.

2. **Console Logging:**
   - Use `console.log()`, `console.error()`, and `console.warn()` effectively to track down issues.
   - Implement structured logging to make it easier to read and analyze.

3. **Breakpoints:**
   - Set breakpoints in the Sources tab to pause code execution and inspect variable states.
   - Step through code to understand the flow and identify where issues occur.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Practice using `try...catch` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
   - Learn how to catch and handle asynchronous errors with promises and async/await.

5. **Testing:**
   - Review unit tests and integration tests concepts.
   - Consider using testing libraries like Jest or Mocha to write tests for your code.

### **üìù Tasks for You:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the topics listed above and create summary notes for each.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Debug any previous projects you've worked on using the techniques outlined.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Try to create a new mini-project or small feature using Web Workers or Service Workers to reinforce your learning.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Engage with online coding platforms (like LeetCode or HackerRank) to practice problems related to the topics discussed.
