### **📚 Day 1: JavaScript Introduction & Setup**  
Welcome to Day 1 of your JavaScript learning journey! 🚀 Today, we’ll cover:  
✅ What JavaScript is & how it works  
✅ Setting up your development environment  
✅ Running JavaScript in the browser & VS Code  

---

## **🔹 1. What is JavaScript?**  
JavaScript (JS) is a **high-level, interpreted** programming language that makes websites interactive. It works alongside **HTML** (structure) and **CSS** (styling) to create **dynamic web applications**.  

📌 **Where is JavaScript used?**  
✅ Web Development (Front-end & Back-end with Node.js)  
✅ Game Development  
✅ Mobile Apps (React Native)  
✅ AI & Machine Learning  

🔹 **JavaScript runs inside the browser.** Every modern browser has a **JavaScript engine**:  
- **Chrome** → V8 Engine  
- **Firefox** → SpiderMonkey  
- **Safari** → JavaScriptCore

## **🔹 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment**  
To write and run JavaScript, you need:  
✅ A web browser (Chrome recommended)  
✅ A code editor (VS Code recommended)  

### **Install VS Code**  
1. Download **VS Code** from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
2. Install it on your computer.  
3. Open it and create a new file: **`script.js`**  

---

## **🔹 3. Running JavaScript**
There are two main ways to run JavaScript:  

### **1️⃣ Running in Browser Console**  
1. Open Chrome  
2. Press `F12` or `Right Click → Inspect`  
3. Go to the `Console` tab  
4. Type:  
   ```js
   console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
   ```
5. Press Enter – You’ll see `"Hello, JavaScript!"` printed! 🎉  

### **2️⃣ Running in VS Code**  
1. Open VS Code  
2. Create a file **`script.js`**  
3. Write this code:  
   ```js
   console.log("Welcome to JavaScript!");
   ```
4. Open **Terminal** → Run  
   ```sh
   node script.js
   ```
5. Output: `"Welcome to JavaScript!"`  

**(Install Node.js if not installed: [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/))**

## **🔹 4. Your First JavaScript Program**
Let’s write a simple **addition program**:  

```js
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log("The sum is:", sum);
```
**Output:**  
```
The sum is: 15
```

## **📝 Task for You**  
1️⃣ Open the browser console and try `console.log("I am learning JavaScript!")`.  
2️⃣ Write a simple program in `script.js` to multiply two numbers and print the result.  

**Once you’re done, let me know if you have any questions!** 🔥 Tomorrow, we’ll dive into **Variables & Data Types**. 🚀
