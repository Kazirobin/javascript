## **🔹 1. Review Key Concepts**  

### **✅ Array Basics**  
- Methods: `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, `splice`, `map`, `forEach`.
- Two Pointers Technique: Efficiently solving problems using two pointers.

### **✅ String Manipulation**  
- Common methods: `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `trim()`, `replace()`, `split()`.
- Anagrams: Checking if two strings are anagrams using frequency counting or sorting.

### **✅ Sliding Window Technique**  
- Finding substrings or managing collections of elements with constraints (like unique characters).

### **✅ Trapping Rain Water**  
- Approaches: Brute Force, Two Arrays, and Optimized Two Pointers.
  
### **✅ Mini Project - String Formatter**  
- Functions for trimming, capitalizing, replacing substrings, and counting words.

## **🔹 2. Practice Problems**  

### **✅ Array Problems**  
1. **Two Sum**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.  
2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**: Find the maximum profit you can achieve from a given list of prices.

### **✅ String Problems**  
1. **Valid Anagram**: Implement the function to check if two strings are anagrams.
2. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
3. **Palindromic Substrings**: Count how many palindromic substrings are in a given string.

### **✅ Trapping Rain Water Problem**  
1. Implement the Trapping Rain Water problem using the optimized approach and validate your implementation with different test cases.
