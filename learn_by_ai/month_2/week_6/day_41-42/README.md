## **üîπ Practice Problems**  

### **1. Array Manipulation**  
- Implement a function to rotate an array to the right by `k` steps.
- Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place and return the new length.

### **2. String Manipulation**  
- Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
- Implement a function to find the longest substring without repeating characters.

### **3. HashMap and Sets**  
- Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target (Two Sum).
- Implement a function that takes a list of words and groups them into anagrams.

### **4. Dynamic Programming**  
- Solve the **Climbing Stairs** problem: Given `n` stairs, in how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
- Implement the **House Robber** problem: Given an array of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

### **5. URL Shortener Project**  
- Review your URL shortener implementation and consider enhancements such as:
  - Custom short URL generation
  - Expiration for short URLs
  - Analytics for tracking usage
