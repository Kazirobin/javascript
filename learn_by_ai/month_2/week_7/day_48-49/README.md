# **📚 Day 48-49: Revision & More Problems**  

During these two days, we’ll focus on revising the concepts we’ve learned so far and tackling more problems related to stacks, linked lists, and other data structures. This is a great opportunity to solidify your understanding and practice your problem-solving skills.

---

## **🔹 Revision Topics**  

### **1. Stacks**  
- **Key Concepts**: LIFO (Last In First Out), basic operations (push, pop, peek, isEmpty).
- **Use Cases**: Function call management (call stack), expression evaluation (postfix expressions), and backtracking algorithms.

### **2. Linked Lists**  
- **Singly Linked Lists**: Understand node structure, insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Know how to traverse in both directions and manage pointers for previous and next nodes.
- **Common Problems**: Reversing a linked list, detecting cycles, merging two linked lists.

## **🔹 Practice Problems**  

### **Stack Problems**:
1. **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**  
   Write a function that takes an array of strings representing a reverse Polish notation expression and returns the evaluated result. For example:
   ```js
   Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
   Output: 9 // (2 + 1) * 3
   ```

2. **Daily Temperatures**  
   Given a list of daily temperatures, return a list such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i]` as 0.
   ```js
   Input: [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
   Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
   ```

3. **Min Stack**  
   Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
   - Implement the `CustomStack` class to include a `getMin()` method.

### **Linked List Problems**:
1. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**  
   Write a function that merges two sorted linked lists and returns it as a new sorted list.
   ```js
   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 4, 1 -> 3 -> 4
   Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4
   ```

2. **Remove Nth Node From End of List**  
   Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head.
   ```js
   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, n = 2
   Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5
   ```

3. **Palindrome Linked List**  
   Given a linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.
   ```js
   Input: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1
   Output: true
   ```

## **📝 Tasks for You**  
- Work through the practice problems and implement solutions.
- Review your stack and linked list implementations, ensuring you understand each method.
