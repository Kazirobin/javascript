# **üìö Day 68-69: Revision & Debugging ‚Äì Performance & Design Patterns**  

During these two days, we'll focus on revising key concepts related to **Performance Optimization** and **Design Patterns** in JavaScript. This will help reinforce your understanding and prepare you for practical applications in future projects or coding interviews.

## **üîπ Key Concepts in Performance Optimization**  

### **1. Throttling vs. Debouncing**  
- **Throttling**: Ensures a function is called at most once in a specified time interval. Useful for events that can fire rapidly, such as scrolling or resizing.  
- **Debouncing**: Delays the execution of a function until after a specified period of inactivity. Ideal for events like input change or search suggestions where you want to wait for the user to finish typing.

### **2. Memory Management**  
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management process that frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced. Understanding how to manage references effectively can prevent memory leaks.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use closures wisely to avoid retaining references longer than necessary.
  - Clean up event listeners and timers to free memory.

### **3. Performance Profiling**  
- Use browser developer tools to profile performance and identify bottlenecks.
- Focus on optimizing the following:
  - Rendering performance (minimize reflows and repaints).
  - Network performance (reduce API call frequency and payload sizes).

## **üîπ Key Concepts in Design Patterns**  

### **1. Factory Pattern**  
- Simplifies object creation and abstracts the instantiation process.  
- Helps manage different types of objects with a single interface.  
- Use cases: creating UI components, API clients, etc.

### **2. Singleton Pattern**  
- Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.  
- Useful for managing shared resources, like configuration settings or a logging service.

### **3. Observer Pattern**  
- Implements a one-to-many relationship between subjects and observers.  
- Ideal for event handling systems or implementing publish/subscribe patterns.

### **4. Module Pattern**  
- Encapsulates private data and exposes a public API.  
- Helps organize code and avoid polluting the global namespace.

## **üîπ Debugging Techniques**  

### **1. Console Logging**  
- Use `console.log()` strategically to trace the flow of data and identify where things go wrong.

### **2. Breakpoints and Step Debugging**  
- Utilize breakpoints in your browser‚Äôs developer tools to pause execution and inspect variables and call stacks.

### **3. Error Handling**  
- Implement try-catch blocks to gracefully handle exceptions and log useful information for debugging.

### **4. Testing**  
- Write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components. Use libraries like Jest or Mocha to facilitate testing.

## **üìù Revision Tasks**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the concepts of throttling and debouncing. Implement both functions with variations.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Revisit and refactor your throttle function from Day 67 based on best practices discussed.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a small project that utilizes one or more design patterns to manage application state or behavior.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Identify performance bottlenecks in one of your previous projects and outline strategies to optimize it.
