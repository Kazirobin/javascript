# **üìö Day 79-80: LeetCode Mock Interview**  

In these two days, you'll prepare for technical interviews by simulating a LeetCode mock interview experience. This will help you practice problem-solving skills, coding under time constraints, and explaining your thought process.

### **üî∏ Mock Interview Structure:**

1. **Choose a Format:**
   - **Live Coding:** Simulate a live coding interview with a friend or mentor. Use a shared online coding platform (like CoderPad or Replit) to collaborate in real time.
   - **Solo Practice:** If you‚Äôre practicing alone, set a timer and work on problems as if you were in a real interview.

2. **Select Problems:**
   - Choose a mix of problems from different categories (arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.). Aim for a balance of easy, medium, and hard problems.
   - Use LeetCode‚Äôs ‚ÄúInterview‚Äù section to find curated lists of problems frequently asked in interviews.

3. **Time Management:**
   - Set a time limit for each problem (e.g., 30-45 minutes) to simulate real interview conditions.
   - Practice breaking down the problem, developing a plan, coding the solution, and testing it within the time frame.

### **üî∏ Problem-Solving Process:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement and make sure you understand the requirements and constraints. Ask clarifying questions if needed.

2. **Plan Your Approach:**
   - Outline your approach before jumping into coding. Consider edge cases and how you will handle them.
   - Discuss your thought process aloud if in a live coding scenario.

3. **Write Code:**
   - Implement your solution using clear and concise code. Keep your code organized and use meaningful variable names.

4. **Test Your Solution:**
   - After writing your code, test it with different inputs, including edge cases.
   - Check for off-by-one errors, empty inputs, and other common pitfalls.

5. **Explain Your Solution:**
   - Be prepared to explain your thought process, the time and space complexity of your solution, and any trade-offs you made.

### **üî∏ Reflection and Review:**

1. **Review Your Performance:**
   - After each problem, reflect on what went well and what could be improved. Consider timing, clarity of explanation, and correctness of the solution.
   - If you encountered difficulties, revisit the problem later to practice and understand the solution better.

2. **Seek Feedback:**
   - If you did a live coding session, ask for feedback on your problem-solving approach and coding style.
   - Use feedback to identify areas for improvement.

### **üìù Tasks for You:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Complete at least three mock interview problems on LeetCode within the structured format.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Record your thought process and solutions to help with future interviews.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Reflect on your performance and identify key areas to focus on in your ongoing preparation.
